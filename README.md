# Template Funcs

A collection of useful template functions for Go’s `html/template` package.

Unlike other such libraries, this is split into multiple modules so you can pick and choose which ones to add.
Selectively importing only the modules/functions you need can help reduce the number of dependencies & resulting binary size.
